### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A relatively noisy week in performance measurements, particularly on the
`externs` incremental benchmark. Based on the timing of the first noise, this
seems to be due to [#93839], which makes me suspect this is related to PGO or
inlining decisions of some kind. [#94373] might help.

Overall a relatively unchanged to slightly good week, with no outright regressions and most
changes relatively small.

# Quote of the Week

> Due to recent events I feel the need to once again commend the reviewers and ehuss in particular for their amazing communication skills when reviewing PRs like this. I can only imagine how much work it means and how silly some of the changes proposed here might look to a seasoned cargo developer, yet you maintain a constructive, upbeat, and friendly spirit at all times. It's a style that I am aspiring when reviewing PRs myself, and is a prime example for the accessibility and friendliness of the Rust community as a whole.

> Thank you!
